This is mostly a process of what I need to do when preparing a system.
Honestly I think I'll leave this as Arch-only forever, except for a more watered-down version for Ubuntu & Termux because I sometimes use that.

also i have to adjust this to wayland now

pre-install:
    curl
    realpath

mid-install:
    git
    python (for sysm)

post-install:
    lua
    luarocks
        fennel (luarocks install fennel)
            TODO: it's still a struggle to install on the right lua version. To solve this I just copied it from share/5.1 to share/5.3 (awesome uses lua 5.3)
        lfs (luarocks install luafilesystem)
            for acw tools
    bc
    fd
    fzf
    rg
    nnn
    xclip

gui_essentials:
    xinit
    awesome (or the other menu used)
    dmenu (my own build)
        headers/libs for: x11, xinerama, xft
    st (my own build)
        headers/libs for: x11, xinerama(?), xft(?), harfbuzz
    sxhkd
    xgetres
        https://github.com/tamirzb/xgetres
    picom
    xsettingsd
    fcitx5
    xinput
    xcalib or wl-gammarelay (for dotf.wrap.redscreen)
    xbacklight
    playerctl (for play-pause keybinding)

gui_extras:
    ksnip
    kvantum (qt/kde theming)

TODO: .cache/packs and other directories that I forget to make
TODO: my own proper logging dir for this shit
TODO: ksnip config backup
TODO: pulse-autoconf config backup

TODO: relicensing! I still like the WTFYWT license but I have code here that is derived from other repos.
